# NimPile

A C# program of the old but famous Nim Game. <br>
The form design is based on MATERIALSKIN from NuGet.<br>
(As a beginer) The code is a bit scratchy which has a rather loose structure. The computer player is set on the Nim algorithm but there is no way to modify its level. Please be patient. Kindly, ENJOY!

# Known BUGS

1.The program will stuck when two computer players meet in the name array after the one ahead wins. (Think is because the statement of entering the GAMETIMER) <br>
2.The program cannot handle unexpected paste to the textboxes. <br>
3.The synchronization between SLIDER and TEXTBOX in game sometimes won't join. (Probably because my code on handling each of there inputs. I could hardly come up a way to handle both data and data check) <br>
